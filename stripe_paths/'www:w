# Stripe paths
You are gven a tree consisting of n vertices. Root of the tree is located in vertex with index 1.

On the given tree some "stripe paths" are located. "Stripe path" of size k is path from some vertex in the tree towards one of leaves, whose edge's colors match "stripe" pattern. "Stripe" pattern is sequence of colors 

### Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) -- the number of vertices in the tree. The next n - 1 lines describes edges. The i-th edge is represented as three integers x_i, y_i and c_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, 0 <= c_i <= 1), where x_i and y_i are vertices i-th edge connects, c_i is the color of the edge. Its guaranteed that the given set of edges represents form a tree.

### Output
Count of the "stripe paths" in the given tree.
